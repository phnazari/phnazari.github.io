In particular, we utilize the dual representation introduced in <a href="/blog/2025/dual-representation/">part one</a> to assess the complexity of ReLU networks.</p> <p>As complexity measures, we use the number of affine regions in the setting of regression (as in <d-cite key="montufar2014number, zhang2018tropical, raghu2017expressive, pascanu2013number"></d-cite>) and the number of linear pieces in the decision boundary in the setting of binary classification (as in <d-cite key="piwek2023exact"></d-cite>). As we will show, these two complexity measures can be directly tied to the dual representation: the number of linear pieces in the decision boundary corresponds to the number of a specific kind of edge in an upper convex hull (<a href="#corollary:nn-boundary-dual" class="cite-stmt hover-link">Corollary</a>), and the number of affine regions corresponds to the number of vertices in another upper convex hull (<a href="#corollary:affine-pieces-mod" class="cite-stmt hover-link">Corollary</a>).</p> <p>Finally, for every claim made in this series, I will refer to the corresponding statement in the thesis.

Fix a dual point $s_{k_{\sigma}} \in S_{I^{\sigma}_=}$.
