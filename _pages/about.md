I am a [CLS](https://learning-systems.org/) PhD candidate in Computer Science in the [CAMAIL](https://camail.org/) group, advised by [Dr. Konstantin Rusch](https://konstantinrusch.com/) ([ELLIS Institute](https://institute-tue.ellis.eu/) and [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/)) and [Prof. Fanny Yang](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/) from [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/de.html). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's in Physics and Mathematics from Heidelberg University where I was affiliated with the lab of [Prof. Fred Hamprecht](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/hamprecht), as well as a Master's in Mathematics from ETH Zürich, where I wrote my thesis in the lab of [Prof. Helmut Bölcskei](https://www.mins.ee.ethz.ch/people/show/boelcskei).


I am broadly interested in `efficient AI`, `geometric deep learning`, as well as `foundations of ML`.
